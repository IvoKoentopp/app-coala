  # Fix game confirmation permissions

  1. Changes
    - Update game_participants policies to allow admins to update any confirmation
    - Add policy for admins to manage all game participants

  2. Security
    - Admins (Contribuinte category) can update any game confirmation
    - Regular members can only update their own confirmations
